// rest operator

//The rest operator in JavaScript is used to collect multiple values into a single variable. It is commonly applied in destructuring assignments and function parameters, making it easy to work with an indefinite number of elements. When used with arrays, the rest operator gathers the remaining elements into an array after extracting specific values. In objects, it collects all properties that are not explicitly extracted into a separate object. In functions, it allows us to accept multiple arguments and handle them as a single array. This makes it especially useful when dealing with dynamic data where the number of elements is unknown. Some common use cases of the rest operator include capturing remaining elements in array destructuring, storing extra properties in object destructuring, and creating functions that accept an arbitrary number of arguments.

//spread operator

//The spread operator in JavaScript is used to expand elements of an array or properties of an object into individual values or key-value pairs. It is commonly applied in combination with the rest operator or spread syntax to achieve more flexible and efficient code. When used with arrays, the spread operator allows us to spread the elements of an array into individual arguments or elements of another array. In objects, it collects all properties into a single object and allows us to spread its properties into individual key-
